First, create a directory where you are going to store all your datasets. 

For this lab, download the input file [Titanic.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGNxqRU02eAvTGih1t0cErB5R05mdOdUBgJZACGcuvs/edit?usp=sharing) and place it into this local directory.

Then fork this lab and clone your forked branch.

Once you finished all the tasks (marked with yellow marker), add, commit, and push your solution.
